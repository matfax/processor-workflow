Processor workflow is a library that facilitates the development of an annotation processor in Java.
It offers an efficient workflow to handle the steps of parsing annotations, extracting useful data, and then generating some java code.

You can see an example of processor workflow implementation in the following projects:
 - Auto Dagger2: [https://github.com/matfax/auto-dagger2](https://github.com/matfax/auto-dagger2)
 - Mortar Architect: [https://github.com/lukaspili/Mortar-architect](https://github.com/lukaspili/Mortar-architect)
